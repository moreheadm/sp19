  each assignment.

  **You have to submit your solution individually.**
  That is, each student should have their own git repo.

- You have a total of *four late days*
  that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them,
  where a late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.

- **Midterm (30%)** :
  Will be held on **Friday May 10** during the lecture.
  The midterm is **closed book**, but you may use a
  double-sided **"cheat sheet"**.
  It **must** be taken at the scheduled time and location.

- **Final (35%)** :
  Will be held on **Friday June 14, from 3:00 -- 6:00pm** in PCNYH 106.

  To turn in your completed final examination, you must
  present a valid UCSD ID at the time the examination
  papers are handed to the instructor; papers not
  accompanied by a valid UCSD ID will not be accepted.
  The final is **closed book**, but you may use a
  double-sided **"cheat sheet"**.
  
- Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will
  be calculated as

      `midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`.

  This means that you get a second chance if you donâ€™t
  do well on the midterm but you must show up to both
  the midterm and the final.
